# netcord
A simple Python implementation that would allow your users/clients/customers to perform ```ping```, ```traceroute```, and ```dig``` on a Discord channel through your own infrastructures.

- Automatically delete result messages to prevent flooding your channel
- Enable/disable a function
- Control channels that the bot can be used in
- Customizable command name and description
- Customizable DoH server
- Customizable ICMP ping count

## Available Commands
```/ping $target``` Ping a given IP address or FQDN.

```/ping4 $target``` Ping a given IPv4 address or FQDN.

```/ping6 $target``` Ping a given IPv4 address or FQDN.

```/traceroute $target``` Traceroute to a given IP address or FQDN.

```/traceroute4 $target``` Traceroute to a given IPv4 address or FQDN.

```/traceroute6 $target``` Traceroute to a given IPv6 address or FQDN.

```/dig_a $target``` Perform a DNS lookup for A records of the target.

```/dig_aaaa $target``` Perform a DNS lookup for AAAAA records of the target.

## Configure, Deploy, and Commission

You need to create a new Discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 

Then you need to create your own ```config.yaml```. You can copy-paste-rename-edit the ```config-example.yaml``` provided.

### Parameters Available

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **bot_token** | Discord bot token. Get one under *Bot > Token* (Click "Reset Token" if it doesn't show). | String |
| **client_id** | Discord client ID. Get one under *OAuth2 > Client information*.| String |
| **allowed_channel_ids** | Discord channel IDs where you want to allow users to use the bot. ([Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID#h_01HRSTXPS5FMK2A5SMVSX4JW4E)) | Integer |
| **doh_server** | DoH server for ```dig_a``` and ```dig_aaaa``` to use. Must follow the [RFC 8484](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484) standards. | String |
| **message_deletion_time** | Time in seconds for a result message to be deleted. Set to 0 to keep persistent.| Integer |
| **ping_count** | Number of execution times for the ```ping```, ```ping4``` and ```ping6``` commands.| Integer |

### Individual Commands

Each command can be customized.

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | Name of a command shown in Discord | String |
| **description** | Description of a command shown in Discord | String |
| **enable** | Enable or disable a command for use | Boolean |

### Deploy Using Docker (Convenient)

Image ```python:3.12-slim``` will be used and would additionally install ```iputils-ping``` and ```traceroute``` in the container.

1. Install Docker on your system. Guide: [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/).

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudo-sc/netcord
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository folder and execute:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

Note: Use ```docker compose up -d``` to run in the background.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: ```network_mode: host``` is written in ```docker-compose.yaml``` to obtain optimal results. Check with the network administrator if this would be allowed in your organization. However, you can adjust to other network settings depending on your desired outcome.

Skip the next section.

### Deploy Using Python3

Nothing special, just install the requirements and run the program.

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 netcord.py
   ```

## Commission
### Invite the Bot to Your Server
Upon starting the container/program, an invitation link will be shown. If you started the container/program in the background, you will need to access the log to retrieve the link.

<img src="https://bucket.sc.sb/netcord-assets/invite-link.png" alt="">

For instance, if you used ```docker compose up -d```, you need to execute:

```bash
docker logs sudo-sc.netcord
```

to see the output.

This invitation link enables the ```applications.commands``` and ```bot``` scopes that are required for functioning. It also permits ```Send Mesages```, ```Manage Messages```, ```Read Message History```, and ```Use Slash Commands```. 

**These are the minimum and required permissions for the bot to function properly.**

## üéâ That's it. Enjoy!

## Aftercare
- You can customize the bot's name, description, tags, avatar (App Icon), banner, etc. at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Issues submitted will be generally reviewed in a timely manner.
- Suggestions are welcomed.
- Pull Requests are welcomed.

## Roadmap
- Implement MTR.
- Implement BGP AS-PATH support.
- Implement Testing from multiple nodes.
